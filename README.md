This was the dataset and my code I used for an Exploratory Data Analysis assignment for the class Interactive Data Science (05-839) at CMU. 
The original dataset and documentation can be found here: https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

To run the data, download the dataset from the Yelp file.

Then, run the jupyter notebook "Creating Yelp Samples - Pittsburgh, Las Vegas.ipynb". This notebook will create subsets of the data (filtering for Pittsburgh and Las Vegas businesses), and will write these subsets into JSON files. These JSON files are needed to run the other jupyter notebook, "Yelp Visualizations.ipynb."

The link to the corresponding writeup is found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a3YQ9c9p2ymwfCbEK7XZxWhZCGOG8YYV1kx_9bLLNuw/edit?usp=sharing. Note that you need to have a CMU email to open this file.
